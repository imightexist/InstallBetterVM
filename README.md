# InstallBetterVM

tihajiosjfoasjd so i made a script based on mkcvm that does this shit:
1. install packages (curl, qemu, qemu utils)
2. installs updates (cuz node wasnt working unless i did that)
3. downloads and runs mkcvm
4. downloads dark mode
5. sets up a windows 7 vm with no turns or resets
6. makes admin password

How to install:
1. download zip
2. extract
3. run terminal
4. go to directory where bettervm is
5. chmod +x mkbettervm.sh
6. ./mkbettervm.sh

Supported Distros:
debian and debian based distros ig

Not fixed yet:
1. resetting admin pass for better usage
2. windows 7 iso link no longer works on collabvm :/
3. tiny7 is now installed but it still says windows 7 vm
