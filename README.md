# Note
This is the public version of the script. 1.2.9 is used on linux versions because it uses mkcvm, but 1.2.10 is used on the windows version. However, we are removing mkcvm from the script cuz it seems like it doesnt work with it.

# InstallBetterVM

so i made a script based on mkcvm that does this shit:
1. install packages (curl, qemu, qemu utils)
2. installs updates (cuz node wasnt working unless i did that)
3. downloads and runs mkcvm
4. downloads dark mode
5. sets up a windows 7 vm with no turns or resets
6. makes admin password

# How to install
For Debian:
<code>sudo apt install -y git && git clone https://github.com/imightexist/InstallBetterVM && cd InstallBetterVM && chmod +x debian.sh && ./debian.sh</code>

For Arch:
<code>sudo pacman -Sy git && git clone https://github.com/imightexist/InstallBetterVM && cd InstallBetterVM && chmod +x arch.sh && ./arch.sh</code>

# Supported Distros
debian and arch (untested)

currently the windows version just has a broken windows version check and downloads curl. use linux.

# to do
1. resetting admin pass for better usage
2. It seems that libjpeg.so.62 is not working which i guess is needed for collabvm to work (not entirely sure but i dont think lubuntu vm can handle libjpeg with the 7 iso)
3. removing mkcvm
4. changing the download links
