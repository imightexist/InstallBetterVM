# InstallBetterVM

so i made a script based on mkcvm that does this shit:
1. install packages (curl, qemu, qemu utils)
2. installs updates (cuz node wasnt working unless i did that)
3. downloads and runs mkcvm
4. downloads dark mode
5. sets up a windows 7 vm with no turns or resets
6. makes admin password

# How to install
1. download zip
2. extract
3. run terminal
4. go to directory where bettervm is
5. chmod +x mkbettervm.sh
6. ./mkbettervm.sh

# Supported Distros
debian and debian based distros ig
arch version is now out but is untested

# Not fixed yet
1. resetting admin pass for better usage
2. It seems that libjpeg.so.62 is not working which i guess is needed for collabvm to work
